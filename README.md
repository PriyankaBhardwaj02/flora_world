# Flora World Android Application
Go green with 'Flora World' Garden community!

# Summary (Work In Progress)
Flora World is an android application for people to get & share info, DIYs, resources regarding different plants to decorate in their garden and get maximum benefits from them, also one can share their plant needs and offers within the community. Especially, during this situation when global warming is on rise, and deforestation is on peak, we realised how important it is for people to help each other to grow plants for themselves & environment. To help with that, the app aims to create virtual community to bring flora world into action, by creating awareness among people about advantages of different types of plants and proper steps, conditions to grow them in ones garden. Also, people can share or order seeds & plants for their garden.

## What's the problem?
Nowadays, our world is facing several challenging environmental problems. So, there's need to become increasingly aware of the problems that surround us. Most of the people are not aware about these problems, and if someone is aware, they don't know the solutions to tackle this, or they need a platform or community where with like minded people they would be able to bring positive inclination in environmental factor by contributing to environment.

## The Solution
Flora world is a garden community platform where people can share garden hacks with each other and help to keep themselves aware about environmental challenges, and as a community they would be able to solve the problem using this Platform.
